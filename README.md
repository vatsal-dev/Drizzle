Utilised Microsoft technologies to display notifications with updated weather information. | Remain informed about weather changes throughout the day, ensuring preparedness for outdoor activities or travel plans. Receive notifications on your desktop, ensuring you don't miss any critical weather information. | GitHub Copilot, <br> PLYER library, <br> SCHEDULE library |
| **Personalization** | Customize app settings, preferences, and the default location. | Employed GitHub Copilot to streamline the development of personalization features, allowing users to customize various app settings. | Tailor the app to suit individual preferences with various options such as using the default location to fetch weather, auto-update the same in the background or even enter a new city and compare weather. Enhances the user experience and creates a personalized weather app environment. | GitHub Copilot |


Prerequisites
-------------

Before running the tool, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

*   Python (version 3.10 or higher)
*   pip (to install Python packages)

Usage
-----

To use the Weather App, follow these steps:

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
    
2.  Run the `main.py` file using the following command:
    
    
    ```cli
    python main.py
    ```
    
3.  The app will prompt you to enter your name and choose an option:
    
    ```sql
    Hey [Your Name]. Welcome back! Choose an option:
    
    1. Use default location
    2. Open default location in system tray
    3. Use a new location
    4. Compare weather of two locations
    
    Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, or 4):
    ```
    
4.  Enter the corresponding number for the desired option and follow the prompts:
    
    *   Option 1: Use the default location
        
        *   The app will retrieve the weather information for the default location.
        *   The weather details will be displayed in the terminal.
    *   Option 2: Open the default location in the system tray
        
        *   The app will open the default location's weather information in the system tray.
        *   A system tray icon will display weather details upon interaction.
    *   Option 3: Use a new location
        
        *   Enter the new location for which you want to retrieve the weather information.
        *   The weather details will be displayed in the terminal.
    *   Option 4: Compare the weather of two locations
        
        *   Enter the names of the two cities you want to compare.
        *   The app will retrieve the weather data for both cities and display a comparison.
5.  After choosing an option, the app will store your name and selected location in a configuration file (`config.json`) for future use.
    
6.  You can rerun the app to perform additional actions or update your preferences.
    

Customization
-------------

*   Default Location: The default location is set in the `CONFIG_FILE` variable in the `main.py` file. You can modify the value to your desired default location.
    
*   Weather API: The Weather App uses external APIs to fetch weather data. The `weather.py` module contains the `get_weather` function, which can be modified to use a different weather API if needed.
